## Coming Soon

# rust-bert-cli
A Rust terminal client implementation of BERT with translate, summarize, question ask and other ML tasks. 

** Will require local installation of PyTorch, which can be either through tch / libtorch in Rust at build time, or you can install it in your PATH.

** Instructions and code coming soon.
