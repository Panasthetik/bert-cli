# rust-bert-cli
A Rust terminal client implementation of BERT with translate, summarize, question ask and other ML tasks. 

** Will require local installation of PyTorch, which can be either through tch / libtorch in Rust at build time, or you can install it in your PATH.

** Also requires rust-bert v. "0.19.0" to run (as specified in the Cargo dependencies), does not work on Mac M1/ ARM64 in rust-bert version 0.21.0 

** More instructions and code coming soon.
